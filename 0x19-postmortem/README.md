Postmortem on Cybersecurity 

Summary
On March 18th 2021 our network services were down from 12:40 am to 5:50 pm CAT. We experienced a major network shutdown. By then we thought it was just a minor issue that we regularly faced. More than 80% of network users were affected by lack of network coverage whereby our clients lost contact services. The main cause of all this was an attack on our servers by the  cyber criminals.			
				Timeline
- The issue was detected by our network intrusion Detection System called Snort.
- The issue was detected by Snort which is a packet sniffer that examines data as it circulates over the network.
- The Cybersecurity and IT teams assumed it was due to a cyber attack because network servers were investigated..
- We tried debugging and restoring the systems servers but we didnâ€™t realise there was a weakest link in our servers.
- The problems were never solved and were escalated to senior cyber professionals and Senior Software engineers.
- The incident ended up by creating patches in the weakest links and restoring backup data.

					Route Cause
The main cause of the issue was the weakest system configuration on our systems and there were not many upgrades of software. The hardware was regularly checked upon and maintained, unlike the software so the cyber criminals found the weakest and un-updated software as an entry point and deployed malware .

Senior Software engineers started to work on the software updates and debugging while Cybersecurity personnel started to check on system vulnerabilities and simulated hacking by penetration testing.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Improve access control on personal data
- Upgrade software systems and cloud security
- Introduce Penetration testing on the network
- Regular vulnerability checks and possible data monitoring

					ToDo list
- This is what we did and what others can do as well, Only data professionals can have access to the servers.
- Backup should be a regular thing to do to prevent permanent data loss in case of any kind of disaster.
- Hiring penetration testers to do the hacking simulations on the network to evaluate the vulnerability of the next possible attack.
- Always collaborate with third parties in terms of data safety and security.
